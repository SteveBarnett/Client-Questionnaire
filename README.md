Template questionnaire for freelance work

## Questions

* **Timing**. What's the start date, end date, and the reason for those dates?
* **Scope**. What services do you require: User Experience, Design, Development? What stuff do you have already? Who's on your team for this project?
* **Money**. How much money have you put aside for this? Is it more like R10,000, R100,000, or R1,000,000? A shed, a house, or a castle? I charge {{ week rate }}.
* **Iron Triangle**. How flexible are these three things?

---

## Not for me if...

* **Timing**. Super-short timeline.
* **Scope**. Very vague scope. In a silo away from others working on the project.
* **Money**. Won't talk about money. Won't pay 50% deposit to book time in the calendar.
* **Iron Triangle**. All three fixed.
